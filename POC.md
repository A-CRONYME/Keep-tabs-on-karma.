# Shitlist: Proof of Concept (POC)

Problem: People often harbor lingering curiosity or a need for closure regarding past "foes" (e.g., toxic ex-partners, bad bosses, bullies). Current social media is not the appropriate venue for tracking these individuals due to public exposure, privacy concerns, and the potential for misinterpretation.

Solution: "Shitlist" is a private, secure, web-based application that functions as a personal digital ledger. It allows users to discreetly track the long-term status of individuals on their personal list, providing a space for catharsis, curiosity, and a personal sense of karma.

### POC Goal: To build a minimal, functional prototype that demonstrates the core user experience: viewing a private list, adding a new "foe," and updating their status. This POC will validate the technical feasibility and core user interface flow.

### Target User Persona
Name: Alex
Age: 32
Profession: Software Developer
Backstory: Alex had a manager who stole their work and created a toxic work environment before Alex finally quit. Alex has moved on, but occasionally wonders if that manager ever faced consequences for their actions. Alex wants a private place to log any news or updates they hear, not for public shaming, but for their own sense of closure.
### Key Features for POC
Display a Private List: A view showing all "foes" currently on the user's list.
Add a New Foe: A form to add a new person to the list with a name and category.
Update Foe Status: A mechanism to add a new status update to an existing foe.
